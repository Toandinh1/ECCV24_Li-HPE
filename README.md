# HPE-Li model:
This is the official source code of "HPE-Li: WiFi-enabled Lightweight Dual Selective Kernel Convolution for Human Pose Estimation" paper, which was published at ECCV 2024.
You can check the extension version (including baselines, scripts,...) in the TAI branch. This is a version of HPE-Li's extension, which is published in the IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence journal (named HPE-Li++). This repository allows researchers and practitioners to easily reproduce our results on MM-Fi [1] and WiPose [2] datasets.
