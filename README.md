# HPE-Li model:
This repo is the official implementation for [HPE-Li: WiFi-enabled Lightweight Dual Selective Kernel Convolution for Human Pose Estimation](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2024/papers_ECCV/papers/04496.pdf), which was published at ECCV 2024. You can check the extension version in the TAI branch. This is a version of HPE-Li's extension, which is published in the IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence journal (named HPE-Li++). This repository allows researchers and practitioners to reproduce our results on MM-Fi and WiPose datasets.
